## 🚀 Project Summary

This project explores a dataset of top YouTube channels by subscriber count. Using Python's data analysis libraries, we perform cleaning, exploration, and visualization to understand:

- Which categories dominate YouTube
- Geographic distribution of top channels
- Correlation between views, videos, and subscribers
- Outliers and trend patterns in channel performance

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies

- 🐍 Python (pandas, NumPy)
- 📊 Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn
- 📁 Dataset: `topSubscribed.csv` from Kaggle or YouTube Stats

---

## 📈 Key Insights

- 📌 Entertainment dominates subscriber count, but **Music** and **Gaming** also lead in engagement.
- 🌎 Most top channels originate from the **United States**, **India**, and **Brazil**.
- 🔍 Identified outliers like **T-Series** and **MrBeast** for subscriber/view ratios.
- 🎯 Channels with fewer videos sometimes outperform heavily active ones due to content quality or viral impact.
